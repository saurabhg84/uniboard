= Details =

While you are using the uNiBoard v1.1 on windows you are bound to use WinAVR. The usbasp driver provided  in the downloads section would sometimes fail to work with other (latest) version of WinAVR. Hence, to ensure that your toolchain and driver works correctly, we advise you to use the WinAVR2007 version provided on the downloads section along with the usbasp driver provided. For any other mixes and matches of WinAVR and usbasp driver, we do not guarantee success. We will very soon find a usbasp driver that works with the latest version of WInAVR. Till then you can continue using WinAVR2007.
