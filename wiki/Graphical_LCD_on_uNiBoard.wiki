_Inrefacing Nokia 3310 Graphical LCD to uNiBoard v1.1_

= *Description* =

    The Nokia 3310 Graphical LCD has PCD8544 controller (48 Ã— 84 pixels matrix LCD controller/driver - Datasheet provided) which has an SPI interface. Commands and data are sent to the LCD using SPI pins on uNiBoard.
    The bitmaps are converted to hex code using FASTLCD v1.2.0 software by Bojan I. MICRODESIGN which are then stored in flash memory. They are fetched from flash and then displayed on GLCD, this is achieved through the use of "pgmspace.h" which enables user to access data stored in program space i.e. flash memory.
