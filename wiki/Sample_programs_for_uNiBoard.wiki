Sample programs on uNiBoard v 1.1.

Here are the sample programs for uNiBoard v 1.1 in the download section,
There are two sample codes on with RTOS(ucos-ii) and other without RTOS. Both links are as follows:
link(NON-RTOS): http://uniboard.googlecode.com/files/NON_RTOS.zip
link(RTOS): http://uniboard.googlecode.com/files/RTOS.zip
link(Test_Program_with_RTOS): http://uniboard.googlecode.com/files/TEST_PROGRAM.zip

I would suggest you to tryout writing the code yourself and not to copy this codes, if you are a student. You can use it for reference.
