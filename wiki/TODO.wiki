= Projects to be undertaken for uNiBoard v1.1 =

The following are projects which we plan to undertake/delegate. The list is not exhaustive and open for more additions


= Recommended topics =

1. Adding PS2 interface: To start off with, this would include displaying characters typed using keyboard on UART or LCD

2. Interfacing GLCD (Nokia 3310)

3. Interfacing Color LCD 

4. Converting VT102 (Hyper-terminal/GTk-term) based game applications to GLCD based game applications

5. Adding CMOS Image sensor (C3088) module interface

6. Software UART (to have additional virtual UART interfaces on the board)

7. Porting uip stack (along with SPI based Ethernet controller)

8. Demonstrating telnet on uNiBoard

9. Multi-board communication using CAN transceivers

10. Mesh Network using Xbee modules

11. FTP using Xbee
